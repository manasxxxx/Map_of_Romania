# Map_of_Romania

# Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of three fundamental search algorithms: BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search), and UCS (Uniform Cost Search). These algorithms are demonstrated using the map of Romania, which is a classic example used by Russell Novig in his book "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" to explain various search algorithms.

# BFS IMPLEMENTATION

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm that explores nodes level by level. Starting from a given node, it explores all its adjacent nodes before moving on to their adjacent nodes, ensuring that the closest vertices are visited first. BFS is widely used in graph-based algorithms such as Dijkstra’s shortest path, Kahn’s algorithm, and Prim’s algorithm. It is also useful in detecting cycles in graphs, finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs, and solving many other problems.

# DFS IMPLEMENTATION

Depth-First Search (DFS) is another fundamental graph traversal algorithm, which explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It differs from BFS in that it goes as deep as possible in one direction before moving to another branch. This makes DFS suitable for problems that require exploring all possibilities, such as finding all paths between two nodes or solving puzzles like mazes.

# UCS IMPLEMENTATION

Uniform Cost Search (UCS) is a search algorithm that extends BFS by incorporating edge weights, making it suitable for finding the least-cost path in a weighted graph. UCS is essentially a variant of BFS that prioritizes paths with the lowest cumulative cost, making it useful in applications such as finding the shortest path in a road network where different routes have different distances.
